I used django - graphene to solve the problem.

I restored the postgresql dump and then used inspectdb command to configure database in my django project.

Defined the queries in scemas.py file in app

There are three types of queries:
1. all branches, all banks --> return a list of all corresponding objects.
2. branches given ifsc or branch , bank given id or name ---> returns a unique corresponding object.
3. branches given city, state, district, bank_Name, bank_Id --> return a list of all corresponding objects.


Time taken: 
I got the assignment 3 days ago, but couldn't find time to work on it. So, I worked on it for almost one and a half days.
